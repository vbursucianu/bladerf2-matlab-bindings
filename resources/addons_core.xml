  <description>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experimental toolbox for BladeRF 2.0 with MATLAB and Simulink (Work in Progress).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package is based on the matlab bindings for bladerf from : https://github.com/vbursucianu/bladeRF
It has been modified to make it work with the bladeRF 2.0 and provides a convenient way to use the bladeRF 2.0 with Matlab/Simulink.

# Installation requirements:
Make sure you have libbladeRF and bladeRF-CLI installed. On windows you can easily install it via:
https://www.nuand.com/win_installers/
This installer should install everything in "C:\Program Files\bladeRF". In that location, delete the folder named "matlab" since this toolbox is meant to remplace it with the right files for the bladeRF 2.0 
You can also install "libbladeRF" and "bladeRF-CLI" from source: https://github.com/vbursucianu/bladeRF

# Known issues (Work in progress):
- Rx Sampling Rate seems locked to 3 MSps for the Simulink Receiver.
- Simulink blocs does not gives the option for channel selection....yet

# Troubleshooting:
- If the library doesn't appear in Simulink:
 1. Press F5 in the library browser to update the library index.
 2. If it still doesn't appear, make sure that the toolbox is in the matlab path.

# Platform Compatibility:
Linux and MacOS will be tested once everything works on Windows.</description>
